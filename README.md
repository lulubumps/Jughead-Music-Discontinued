# Jughead Music (Descontinuado)

<img src="/images/6016221.jpg" alt="Website Screenshot"/>

## Starting 🚀
This project was developed for educational purposes. "Jughead Music" is a mini version of Spotify made with PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS for proper design and function. Oh sure, and it's very outdated and there's a chance it won't work properly (I recommend that you use it only as a very beta version and not as a final project).

### Requirements 📋
You need to have a program to create databases locally (if you use Windows, you can use Xampp).
- You must create databases within PHPMyAdmin.
- You should review [Conexión.php](https://github.com/lulubumps/Jughead-Music-Discontinued-/blob/master/conexion.php) to check how it works correctly.

## Version 📌
PHP version 7.4 was used for this project.

## Built with 🛠️
* [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html) - PHP development environment
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) - Framework for web and mobile construction
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Used to write the codes
