# Description
About A free Spotify attempt developed for programming classes (the project hasn't been touched for more than 4 years).

# Features
This project was developed for educational purposes. "Jughead Music" is a mini version of Spotify made with PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS for proper design and function. Oh sure, and it's very outdated and there's a chance it won't work properly (I recommend that you use it only as a very beta version and not as a final project).
